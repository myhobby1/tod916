I useed to be a shepherd in the Lub region of France.
 It was a very isolated place,, so I was often all alone in the pasture.
Sometimes, I did not see many people for weeks.
During those weeks, I only had my dog and the flocks of sheep to ccompany
me.

 From time to time, I saw a loner who lived on Mount llure.
 He would come down to hear some news of the outside wourld.
 Also, I sometimes saw coal miners.
 They worked in the coal mines near my field, so I spoke with them 
as they ewnt back and forth to the coal mines.
